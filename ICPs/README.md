# CounselStack ICP Profiles — Overview

Does it match how they think?"

## Who Actually Reads CounselStack

Based on the market data:

- **Firms with < 6 attorneys = 75%+ of all US law firms** (ABA data)
- Solo practitioners represent ~40% of all law firms
- **47% of small firms use practice management software** — half still don't, and those who do are often looking to switch
- **77% of small law firms say they spend too much time on admin** (Thomson Reuters 2023)
- Primary audience: Personas 1 and 2 (in search mode), with Persona 3 being a smaller but higher-value segment

### Realistic Traffic Breakdown (Estimated)
- **~55–60%** Solo practitioners (Persona 1) — highest search volume, most price-sensitive
- **~30–35%** Small firm attorneys and partners (Persona 2) — slightly more deliberate research
- **~10–15%** Practice managers and legal ops (Persona 3) — lowest volume, highest buying authority, most feature-sophisticated

## The Shared Frustration Stack

All three personas share these underlying frustrations — what separates them is degree, scale, and context:

1. **Time spent on admin vs. legal work** — the core tension for everyone
2. **Billing inefficiency** — money earned but not captured
3. **Trust accounting anxiety** — IOLTA compliance is high-stakes for all
4. **Too many disconnected tools** — the "software sprawl" problem
5. **Migration paralysis** — fear of switching systems
6. **Vendor trust deficit** — tired of overpromised, underdelivered demos

## How Practice Area Changes Everything

Practice area is a critical variable that cuts across all three personas. The same attorney managing software at a PI firm has radically different needs than one at an estate planning firm.

### Practice Area Matrix

| Practice Area | Billing Model | Trust Acct Priority | Key Unique Need | Relevant Keywords |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Personal Injury** | Contingency | Medium (cost advances) | Medical records mgmt, settlement calculators, HIPAA | "PI case management software", "contingency billing" |
| **Family Law** | Hourly + Retainer | High (retainer replenishment) | Court calendar, domestic relations forms, high-conflict client comms | "family law practice management", "retainer tracking" |
| **Immigration** | Flat Fee | Low | USCIS form automation, immigration court deadlines, language access | "immigration case management software" |
| **Estate Planning / Probate** | Flat Fee | Medium | Document assembly (wills, trusts), probate calendaring | "estate planning software", "probate management" |
| **Criminal Defense** | Flat Fee | Low | Urgent court deadlines, public defender vs private billing | "criminal defense case management" |
| **Civil Litigation** | Hourly | Medium | Discovery management, opposing counsel tracking, statute of limitations | "litigation management software" |
| **Business / Corporate** | Hourly + Transactional | Low-Medium | DMS integration, matter profitability, deal tracking | "corporate law practice management" |
| **Real Estate** | Flat Fee + Hourly | Medium | Closing deadline tracking, title/escrow coordination | "real estate law software" |
| **General Practice** | Mixed | Varies | Maximum flexibility, multi-area templates | "general practice law software" |

### Key Practice Area Insights

**PI firms** are a high-value segment — they have volume, they're revenue-focused, and they're often willing to pay more for software that tracks medical costs and settlement math. Tools like CloudLex, Filevine, and Needles/Neos are PI-specific alternatives that compete with Clio/MyCase in this segment.

**Family law** firms have the highest IOLTA sensitivity outside of large transactional practices. Retainer replenishment automation is a hot topic. Forms automation (state-specific family court documents) is a significant differentiator.

**Immigration** attorneys often want flat-fee billing and form automation but have unique compliance needs (USCIS deadlines, visa types, status tracking). Software like Docketwise is immigration-specific.

**Estate planning/probate** attorneys are heavy document assembly users. They value software with built-in templates or tight integration with document automation tools like HotDocs, Pathagoras, or Lawyaw.
