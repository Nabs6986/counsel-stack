## A Day in Jordan's Life

**8:00 AM** — Reviews daily dashboard in the practice management software. Flags two attorneys who haven't logged time in 3 days. Sends a gentle Slack. (Again.)

**9:00 AM** — Monthly partner meeting prep. Prepares billing realization report by attorney. Knows one partner will push back on the numbers. Prepares for that conversation.

**10:30 AM** — Onboarding call with a new software vendor (rival to current PMS). Takes notes on feature gaps vs. current system. Adds to the comparison matrix she's been building for 6 months.

**12:00 PM** — Lunch at desk. Answering a paralegal's question about why a client's trust account is showing a different balance in the software vs. the bank statement. Troubleshoots for 45 minutes.

**1:30 PM** — Receives a complaint from a senior partner: the software update last week changed the invoice format and "now it looks unprofessional." Jordan has to find the setting to revert this. Spends 2 hours on it.

**3:30 PM** — Takes a reference call with a practice manager at another firm. Asked her contacts for honest feedback on the two shortlisted vendors before presenting to partners.

**5:00 PM** — Prepares a one-page summary for the partner meeting: "Why we should switch from [Current Software] to [New Software], total 3-year cost, migration timeline, expected ROI." The partners will spend 10 minutes on a decision Jordan spent 3 months researching.

## Top 5 Pain Points (Ranked)

### #1 — Attorney Buy-In and Adoption (The Wall)
Jordan can find the perfect software, build the case for it, survive the migration, and then watch it fail because two senior partners won't change their workflow. This is the defining frustration of the role. Training is mandatory but compliance isn't. The software she implements is only as good as attorney compliance with it.

> **Real voice**: *"My experience has been that people hate it or think it is inadequate until IT knows it inside and out and trains them properly. Dozens of times I've sat with attorneys and after showing them how to complete tasks they didn't realize they could do quicker, they've gained a better appreciation."* — r/Lawyertalk (Firm Admin, ProLaw user)

> **Real voice**: *"Most of these platforms are built for mid-sized firms with internal ops teams that have expertise in workflow integrations plus the knowledge of the practice."* — r/LawFirm (legal ops professional)

### #2 — Managing Multi-System Complexity (Integration Hell)
Jordan inherited a Frankenstein stack: billing software from 2015, Outlook calendars no one syncs, a shared drive that's barely organized, LawPay for payments, QuickBooks for accounting. Her job is to consolidate this into something coherent. But every time she evaluates a "unified" platform, it turns out one crucial thing (accounting, specific integrations, document assembly) still requires an add-on.

### #3 — Vendor Promises vs. Reality (Trust Deficit)
Jordan has been burned before. Vendors promise seamless migrations, responsive support, feature parity. What actually happens: the migration takes 4x longer than estimated, support tickets get closed with stock answers, and the feature that was "coming in Q3" is still on the roadmap 2 years later. She's deeply skeptical of vendor-provided information and actively seeks third-party validation.

### #4 — ROI Justification to Partners (Upward Accountability)
Every major software purchase requires Jordan to make a business case to attorneys who think in billable hours, not SaaS subscriptions. She must translate "this software will save 2 hours per attorney per week" into hard dollars. She needs tools to measure and demonstrate impact — before AND after purchase. Without clear ROI metrics, she can't get budget approved.

### #5 — Reporting and Visibility Gaps (Operational Blindness)
Jordan needs a real-time picture of: billing realization by attorney, trust account status, accounts receivable aging, matter profitability, and client intake conversion. Most legal practice management software gives her basic reports but not the custom views and cross-matter analytics she needs. She often exports to Excel and builds her own reports — which is a sign of failure, not success.

---

## Goals (What "Success" Looks Like)

1. **Single source of truth** — one platform that all attorneys actually use, where all data lives
2. **Reporting that impresses partners** — dashboard they check themselves, not wait for Jordan to pull
3. **Clean trust accounting** — zero discrepancies, automated reconciliation
4. **Onboarding efficiency** — new attorney can be productive in 48 hours, not 2 weeks
5. **Staff efficiency** — paralegal time saved on admin = more billable support work
6. **Measurable ROI** — can show partners: "We increased realization by X% since switching"
7. **Strong vendor relationship** — responsive support, roadmap communication, account management
8. **Compliance readiness** — ready for a bar audit or partner review at any moment

## Decision Factors (Ranked by Importance)

| Rank | Factor | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **#1** | **Integration Depth** | Must connect to existing accounting (QuickBooks/Xero), email, e-signature, payment processing |
| **#2** | **Reporting & Analytics** | Custom reports, partner dashboards, trust reconciliation reports |
| **#3** | **Migration Support Quality** | Not just "we'll migrate your data" but HOW they do it, guarantees, timeline |
| **#4** | **Attorney UX / Adoption** | Simplest possible UI — because Jordan will have to sell this to resistant attorneys |
| **#5** | **Trust Accounting** | Robust, auditable, automated |
| **#6** | **Customer Support & SLA** | Dedicated account manager, not a ticket queue; phone support, not just chat |
| **#7** | **Scalability** | Will it still work at 20, 30, 50 attorneys? |
| **#8** | **Total Cost of Ownership** | Per-user price + add-ons + implementation + training + annual increases |
| **#9** | **Security & Compliance** | SOC 2, data encryption, access controls |
| **#10** | **Implementation Timeline** | Realistic timeline: Jordan needs to plan around court dates, tax season, vacation schedules |

## Where Jordan Researches

1. **Third-party review sites** (Capterra, G2, Software Advice) — reads and cross-references reviews
2. **Lawyerist reviews** — considers this the most thorough editorial source for legal software
3. **Legal administrator networks** (ALA — Association of Legal Administrators) — peer network
4. **LinkedIn and professional communities** — posts questions to legal ops groups
5. **Vendor reference calls** — demands 3+ references from firms of similar size/practice area
6. **ABA TECHSHOW** — attends or follows coverage for product comparisons
7. **Legal tech newsletters** (LawNext, Legaltech News, Above the Law's innovation section)
8. **Reddit (r/LawFirm, r/legaltech)** — reads extensively, often posts questions
9. **Product demos** — schedules 3–5 demos, uses standardized RFP questions
10. **Trial periods** — always wants a trial before contract; asks for longer trials than vendors offer

> ⚠️ **CounselStack opportunity**: Jordan is the most sophisticated researcher of the three personas. She wants feature-by-feature comparison tables, migration success criteria, and honest downsides — not puff pieces. Content that calls out vendor weaknesses alongside strengths will earn her trust.

## Objections (Why She Hesitates)

| Objection | What She's Actually Thinking |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| "Partners won't approve the budget" | "Even if I'm convinced, I need a bulletproof business case that will survive 5 minutes of partner scrutiny." |
| "Migration risk is too high" | "I've been in a bad migration before. I need guarantees, not promises." |
| "We'd have to retrain everyone" | "Training time = lost billable hours. Partners will blame me if productivity dips during transition." |
| "The vendor might not exist in 3 years" | "I've been burned when a vendor was acquired and the product pivoted. I need stability signals." |
| "We're locked into a contract" | "Annual contracts with auto-renew clauses make me nervous. What's the exit strategy?" |
| "The current system isn't THAT bad" | "The pain isn't visible enough to justify the political capital it takes to get this through." |

## Language & Tone

**How Jordan talks:**
- Business and operations language: ROI, efficiency, utilization rates, realization, lockup, overhead
- Technical but not developer-level: knows what APIs and integrations are, evaluates them practically
- Methodical, process-oriented, document-everything style
- Formal in vendor communications, less formal in peer networks (Reddit, ALA)

**What resonates:**
- Feature comparison tables (she builds these anyway — give them to her pre-built)
- Integration depth and API documentation
- Case studies from similar-sized firms with similar practice areas
- Migration process documentation and timelines
- "Your dedicated account manager will..." (support quality matters to her)
- Total cost of ownership breakdowns, not just per-user pricing
- Data export options (she worries about vendor lock-in)

**What doesn't resonate:**
- Marketing videos with actors using fake software
- "Industry-leading" without evidence
- Testimonials from solos when she's evaluating for a 15-attorney firm
- Feature lists without noting what tier they're available in
- Any content that implies attorneys run the software selection process

---

## Trigger Events (What Makes Her Search NOW)

1. **Old software being sunset** — vendor acquired, product EOL'd, server goes down
2. **Firm growth milestone** — hitting 10+ attorneys, current system clearly can't scale
3. **Partner mandate** — "We're switching, figure it out" (reactive search)
4. **Current vendor price increase** — annual renewal shock triggers re-evaluation
5. **Compliance scare** — trust audit, bar complaint, or close call with client fund error
6. **New managing partner** — incoming partner who used different software at previous firm
7. **New hire who can't use the system** — "I've been on Clio for 7 years, I can't use this"
8. **Remote work demands** — attorneys want to work from home, on-premise server can't support it
9. **Accounting breakdown** — reconciliation taking days instead of hours, bookkeeper/CPA demands better data

## The Buying Process (Jordan's Journey)

Unlike the solo attorney who acts alone or the partner who makes gut decisions, Jordan runs a structured procurement process:

**Stage 1: Internal Assessment** (1–2 months)
- Documents current pain points with specific examples
- Surveys attorneys and staff about frustrations
- Builds requirements list (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Gets informal budget approval from managing partner

**Stage 2: Market Research** (1–2 months)
- Reads review sites, Reddit, Lawyerist
- Attends or reviews conference content
- Builds a 10–15 vendor longlist
- Shortlists to 3–5 based on criteria match

**Stage 3: Active Evaluation** (1–2 months)
- Sends RFP or evaluation questionnaire to shortlisted vendors
- Schedules demos with her AND key attorneys present
- Calls references (firms of similar size, practice area)
- Negotiates pricing and contract terms

**Stage 4: Internal Selling** (1–4 weeks)
- Presents recommendation to partners
- Addresses objections (usually cost and migration risk)
- Gets sign-off

**Stage 5: Implementation** (1–3 months)
- Manages migration project
- Coordinates attorney training sessions
- Sets KPIs for measuring success post-launch

> **CounselStack implication**: Jordan is at multiple stages simultaneously. Content should target each stage: comparison tables for Stage 2, "questions to ask your vendor" for Stage 3, ROI business case templates for Stage 4.

## Synthesized Quotes

> *"I spent three months building the case for a software switch. The partners spent ten minutes approving it. But those ten minutes took everything I had."*

> *"The demo always looks perfect. What I want to know is what happens at month six, when you've hit an edge case and you're waiting on a support ticket."*

> *"Attorney adoption is my job after we buy. I need the software to be so simple that even the partner who still uses a legal pad has no excuse not to use it."*

> *"I need a review site that's honest about the downsides. Every vendor's website says they're the best. I need someone to tell me what's actually broken."*

> *"The integration with QuickBooks is what makes or breaks my evaluation. If I'm entering data in two systems, we've failed before we've started."*

> *"I want to see the vendor's churn rate. If firms keep switching away from them after 2 years, that tells me everything."*

## Practice Area Variations for This Persona

| Practice Area | Jordan's Additional Focus |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **PI / High-volume litigation** | Medical records integration, cost advance tracking, settlement math, Filevine or CloudLex may be on her radar |
| **Estate planning / Elder law** | Document assembly depth, probate calendaring, fiduciary accounting reporting |
| **Business / Corporate** | Deal management, matter profitability by client, DMS integration (NetDocuments, iManage) |
| **Multi-practice (mixed firm)** | Maximum configurability — needs workflow templates for each practice area, not one-size-fits-all |
| **Family law volume shop** | High-volume case management, retainer replenishment automation, court deadline tracking |

## The Competitive Intelligence Jordan Needs

She wants to know:
- Which platforms have had security breaches?
- Which vendors raised prices dramatically on renewal?
- Which have been acquired by private equity and had service degrade?
- Which platforms have the best data export (for future migration)?
- Which have the most open API ecosystem?
- What's the *real* customer service experience 2 years in, not during the sales process?
