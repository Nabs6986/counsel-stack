**Clio is the most popular legal practice management software in the U.S. — but it's also expensive, locks features behind higher tiers, and charges $69/user/month for full functionality.** Solo practitioners and small firms paying $828–$1,200/year per attorney are looking for better value without sacrificing core features.

We analyzed 23 legal PM platforms and talked to attorneys who switched away from Clio. Here are the 7 alternatives that came up most often, ranked by use case.

## Why Attorneys Leave Clio

Before we dive into alternatives, here's what attorneys told us they dislike about Clio:

- **Price creep** — Base plan ($49/user/mo) lacks time tracking and billing. You need Clio Suite ($69) for full features.
- **Hidden fees** — Processing fees for Clio Payments (2.9% + $0.30), document storage limits (10GB on base plan), extra charges for SMS, e-signatures, and AI features.
- **Feature lock-in** — Critical tools like document automation require Clio Suite ($69) or Clio Complete ($99).
- **Overkill for small firms** — 250+ integrations and enterprise features that solo and 2-attorney firms never use.
- **Support quality decline** — Multiple Reddit threads complain about slower response times as Clio scales.

## #1: MyCase — Best Overall Alternative

**Best for:** Solo attorneys and firms under 5 attorneys who want a complete system without feature tiering.

### What You Get
- Unlimited time tracking, billing, invoicing (all plans)
- Client portal with secure messaging and document sharing
- Trust accounting (IOLTA-compliant)
- Built-in payment processing (MyCase Payments)
- Email and calendar sync
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Unlimited document storage

### Pricing
- **Basic:** $39/user/month (billed annually) — full PM features
- **Pro:** $69/user/month — adds document automation and advanced reporting
- **Advanced:** $89/user/month — adds lead management and custom fields

### Why Attorneys Choose It
MyCase doesn't lock time tracking or billing behind higher tiers. The $39 plan includes what Clio charges $69 for. You get all core PM features without paying for integrations you'll never use.

The trust accounting is simpler than Clio's — fewer clicks to record deposits and withdrawals. The client portal is comparable (secure messaging, document sharing, e-signatures).

### Trade-offs
- Fewer third-party integrations (~50 vs. Clio's 250+)
- AI features are newer and less mature than Clio's
- Document automation requires the $69 Pro plan

## #2: PracticePanther — Best for Flat Fee Practices

**Best for:** Estate planning, immigration, and criminal defense attorneys who bill primarily flat fees.

### What You Get
- Task automation and workflow templates
- Flat fee billing with payment plans
- Time tracking (if you need it)
- Client portal and secure messaging
- Trust accounting
- Document management with templates
- Mobile app with offline access

### Pricing
- **Solo:** $49/user/month (billed annually)
- **Essential:** $69/user/month — adds document automation
- **Business:** $89/user/month — adds advanced reporting and custom roles

### Why Attorneys Choose It
PracticePanther is built for workflow automation — you can create case templates that auto-generate tasks, send emails, and trigger reminders. For flat-fee practices that handle repetitive cases (probate, uncontested divorce, immigration forms), this saves hours per case.

The mobile app has offline access — you can review case files, log time, and take notes without internet. Syncs when you're back online.

### Trade-offs
- Fewer payment processing options (no Stripe, only PantherPayments or LawPay)
- Steeper learning curve than MyCase
- Some users report the interface feels dated

## #3: Smokeball — Best for Litigators

**Best for:** Civil litigation, family law, and personal injury attorneys who live in court.

### What You Get
- Automatic time tracking (tracks every document, email, call)
- Court rules calendar (auto-calculates deadlines)
- Document automation with 20,000+ legal forms
- Email integration (syncs to case files automatically)
- Trust accounting
- Billing and invoicing

### Pricing
- **Boost:** $99/user/month (billed annually)
- **Grow:** $129/user/month — adds advanced automation
- **Prosper:** Custom pricing — adds integrations and dedicated support

### Why Attorneys Choose It
Smokeball's automatic time tracking captures everything — opening a document, sending an email, making a call. You never have to remember to start a timer. At the end of the day, you review captured time and bill it.

The court rules calendar auto-calculates deadlines based on jurisdiction — you enter a hearing date, it generates all filing deadlines. For litigators, this alone is worth it.

### Trade-offs
- Most expensive alternative ($99 vs. Clio's $69 base)
- Windows desktop required for full features (cloud-only version is limited)
- Hidden merchant fees (multiple attorneys reported unexpected $20–$69 charges)

## #4: CosmoLex — Best All-in-One for Solos

**Best for:** Solo attorneys who want PM + accounting in one system.

### What You Get
- Full practice management (cases, contacts, tasks, calendar)
- Integrated accounting (QuickBooks built-in)
- Trust accounting with 3-way reconciliation
- Time tracking and billing
- Client portal
- Email management

### Pricing
- **Essential:** $89/user/month (billed annually)
- **Premier:** $129/user/month — adds document automation and advanced reporting

### Why Attorneys Choose It
CosmoLex is the only system with full accounting built in — you don't need QuickBooks Online ($50–$180/month). It handles operating account, trust account, and financial reporting in one place.

The trust accounting is rock-solid — 3-way reconciliation catches errors before they become bar complaints. For solo attorneys who hate accounting, this is simpler than juggling Clio + QuickBooks.

### Trade-offs
- Higher starting price ($89 vs. competitors' $39–$69)
- Smaller integration library
- Learning curve for the accounting features

## #5: Lawmatics — Best for Lead Management

**Best for:** Solo and small firms focused on growth and client acquisition.

### What You Get
- CRM with intake automation
- Lead tracking and conversion analytics
- Email marketing and drip campaigns
- Client portal and e-signatures
- Basic case management
- Billing and invoicing (add-on)

### Pricing
- **Starter:** $99/month (unlimited users) — CRM + intake
- **Pro:** $199/month — adds automation and advanced reporting
- **Elite:** $399/month — adds API access and custom integrations

### Why Attorneys Choose It
Lawmatics is a CRM first, PM second. If you're focused on converting consultations and managing leads, it's unmatched. You can automate intake forms, send follow-up sequences, and track conversion rates.

The unlimited users pricing is great for small firms — you pay per firm, not per attorney. A 3-attorney firm pays $99 total, not $99 × 3.

### Trade-offs
- Case management is basic (no time tracking or trust accounting on base plan)
- Billing requires add-on integration (LawPay, Clio Payments)
- Overkill if you don't need CRM features

## #6: Filevine — Best for Teams Under 10

**Best for:** Growing firms (3–10 attorneys) that need collaboration tools.

### What You Get
- Team collaboration with @mentions and task assignments
- Document management with version control
- Workflow automation
- Time tracking and billing
- Client portal
- Custom fields and reporting

### Pricing
- **Essentials:** $69/user/month (billed annually)
- **Advanced:** $109/user/month — adds advanced automation and integrations
- **Custom:** Contact for pricing — enterprise features

### Why Attorneys Choose It
Filevine is built for teams — multiple attorneys and staff can work on the same case without stepping on each other. The @mention system and task assignments keep everyone aligned.

The custom fields and reporting are more flexible than Clio's — you can build your own dashboards and track firm-specific metrics.

### Trade-offs
- Overkill for solo attorneys
- Steeper learning curve
- No trust accounting built-in (requires third-party integration)

## #7: Free/Budget Options (Under $30/Month)

### Rocket Matter — $39/month for basic plan
Solid time tracking, billing, and document management. Limited integrations.

### Bill4Time — $27/user/month
Time tracking and billing only. No case management.

### Legal Files — $19/user/month
Document management and simple case tracking. No billing.

### Trello + Toggl + QuickBooks — ~$40/month total
DIY stack. Works if you're tech-savvy and have time to set up integrations.

### Pick Lawmatics if:
You're focused on growth. CRM features beat everyone else.

You have a team (3+ attorneys) and need collaboration. Overkill for solos.

## Switching from Clio: What to Expect

Most legal PM platforms offer free migration help — they'll import your:
- Client and matter data
- Time entries and invoices
- Documents (via manual upload or API)
- Calendar events

**Data migration timeline:** 2–4 weeks for small firms (under 5 attorneys). Plan for 1–2 months of parallel systems while you transition.

**Tip:** Export your Clio data as CSV backups before canceling. You'll have a safety net if something goes wrong.

---

## FAQs

### Can I switch from Clio mid-year?
Yes. Most firms do it during a slow period (holiday season or summer). Clio bills annually, so you'll lose the remaining months unless you time it right.

### Will I lose my time entries?
No. All platforms let you import historical time and billing data via CSV or API.

### What about trust accounting?
Export your trust ledger from Clio as CSV. Import it into the new system and reconcile manually for the first month. After that, it's business as usual.

### Do alternatives integrate with QuickBooks?
MyCase, PracticePanther, and Smokeball all integrate with QuickBooks Online. CosmoLex has QuickBooks built in.

### Can I try before I switch?
Yes. All platforms offer 7–14 day free trials. Run both systems in parallel for a few weeks before fully committing.

---

## Bottom Line

**Clio is the market leader, but it's not the best value.** For solo attorneys and firms under 5, MyCase delivers 90% of Clio's features at 60% of the price. PracticePanther beats Clio for flat-fee practices. CosmoLex is better if you want accounting built in.

The only reason to stay with Clio: You need the 250+ integrations or enterprise features. Otherwise, switching saves you $200–$400/attorney/year without losing core functionality.
